# Minithesis

This is is an incredibly minimal implementation of the core idea of Hypothesis,
mostly intended for demonstration purposes to show someone how they might
get the basics of it up and running.

## Notes

* This does not necessarily track the core Hypothesis implementation that closely and is more an "in spirit" implementation.
* This probably doesn't work at all well - it has literally one test and I wrote it in about an hour.
* Pull requests to improve clarity *extremely* welcome. It probably won't ever grow many features (I might implement the database at some point) though because you're not supposed to use it in anger.
* I've used the (sadly defunct) Hypothesis-for-Ruby naming conventions because those are better than the Python ones because I actually put some thought into them.
